I am a computational chemist currently working in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington. My interests lie in applying computational tools to understand chemical reactions from a mechanistic perspective.

About Me
======
I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington in June 2013. The thermodynamics and statistical mechanics coursework I took as an undergraduate inspired me to pursue graduate school, with research focusing on chemical reactivity. 

In September 2013, I joined the PhD program in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Davis in Davis, CA, where I first met my PhD advisor Prof. Dean J. Tantillo, whose research group explored the chemistry of organic reaction mechanisms using computational tools. I was the first graduate student with an emphasis in physical chemistry to join the group (previously, it had been exclusively organic chemists) and I used this specialization to become involved in a unique set of projects that required learning to use tools that were new to the group: ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and Python scripting for analysis. I specifically focused on reactions containing post-transition state bifurcations, a unique class of reactions that are not well-described by traditional transition state theories. 

In September 2018, I joined the [CHemistry and Mathematics in Phase Space (CHAMPS)](https://champsproject.com) program at the University of in Bristol, England to work with Prof. Barry Carpenter, who was one of the first physical organic chemistry researchers to recognize the importance of non-statistical dynamic effects on reaction product outcomes, as well as use reactions with post-transition state bifurcations as case studies for understanding such effects. While at Bristol, I was also able to work with the David Glowacki research group, and our collaboration led to a project using dimensionality reduction to visualize reaction pathways. 

Since April 2020, I have been working in the Pfaendtner Research Group (PRG) in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington (back where I started my academic career!). I am currently exploring the mechanisms of silica oligomerization reactions as well as using transition path sampling (TPS) and aimless shooting to analyze reactions containing post-transition state bifurcations.
