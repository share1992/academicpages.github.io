I am a computational chemist currently working in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington. My interests lie in applying computational tools to understand chemical reactions from a mechanistic perspective. 

About Me
======
I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington in June 2013. The coursework I took as an undergraduate, particularly my thermodynamics and statistical mechanics classes, made me realize that the questions I was the most motivated to understand typically had to do with chemical reactions, and that if I wanted to continue to work on these questions, going to graduate school was the most logical next step. In September 2013, I joined the PhD program in the Department of Chemistry at UC Davis, where I first met my PhD advisor Prof. Dean J. Tantillo.
