Simulating drug binding and unbinding is a challenge, as the rugged energy landscapes that separate bound and unbound states require extensive sampling that consumes significant computational resources. Here, we describe the use of interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as an accurate low-cost strategy for flexible protein-ligand docking. We outline an experimental protocol which enables expert iMD-VR users to guide ligands into and out of the binding pockets of trypsin, neuraminidase, and HIV-1 protease, and recreate their respective crystallographic protein-ligand binding poses within 5â€“10 minutes. Following a brief training phase, our studies shown that iMD-VR novices were able to generate unbinding and rebinding pathways on similar timescales as iMD-VR experts, with the majority able to recover binding poses within 2.15 {\AA} RMSD of the crystallographic binding pose. These results indicate that iMD-VR affords sufficient control for users to carry out the detailed atomic manipulations required to dock flexible ligands into dynamic enzyme active sites and recover crystallographic poses, offering an interesting new approach for simulating drug docking and generating binding hypotheses.},

abstract = {This journal is {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry. Most chemical transformations (reactions or conformational changes) that are of interest to researchers have many degrees of freedom, usually too many to visualize without reducing the dimensionality of the system to include only the most important atomic motions. In this article, we describe a method of using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for analyzing a series of molecular geometries (e.g., a reaction pathway or molecular dynamics trajectory) and determining the reduced dimensional space that captures the most structural variance in the fewest dimensions. The software written to carry out this method is called PathReducer, which permits (1) visualizing the geometries in a reduced dimensional space, (2) determining the axes that make up the reduced dimensional space, and (3) projecting the series of geometries into the low-dimensional space for visualization. We investigated two options to represent molecular structures within PathReducer: aligned Cartesian coordinates and matrices of interatomic distances. We found that interatomic distance matrices better captured non-linear motions in a smaller number of dimensions. To demonstrate the utility of PathReducer, we have carried out a number of applications where we have projected molecular dynamics trajectories into a reduced dimensional space defined by an intrinsic reaction coordinate. The visualizations provided by this analysis show that dynamic paths can differ greatly from the minimum energy pathway on a potential energy surface. Viewing intrinsic reaction coordinates and trajectories in this way provides a quick way to gather qualitative information about the pathways trajectories take relative to a minimum energy path. Given that the outputs from PCA are linear combinations of the input molecular structure coordinates (i.e., Cartesian coordinates or interatomic distances), they can be easily transferred to other types of calculations that require the definition of a reduced dimensional space (e.g., biased molecular dynamics simulations).},

abstract = {Ambimodal reactions involve a single transition state leading to multiple products. In such reactions, transition state theory gives no information about the ratio of products that are formed, and molecular dynamics must be performed to predict this ratio. Understanding the relationship between the transition structure and the product ratio is a long-standing problem in molecular dynamics. We have studied 15 ambimodal pericyclic reactions and investigated the relationship between the TS bond lengths in the saddle points and the product ratios from trajectory simulations. A linear correlation, ln(B:A) = -9.4(Bond 3 - Bond 2), is found with R(2) = 0.92, where A and B refer to the products formed upon formation of bonds 2 and 3, respectively. The correlation shows that the ratio of products formed after the bifurcation is related to the partial bond lengths, and corresponding bond orders, in the transition state.},

@article{Hare2017b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry. Byproducts of chemical reactions are generally thought to result from the competition between two reaction pathways, each with its own rate-determining transition state structure. We show here, however, that pathways with a single transition state structure followed by a post-transition state bifurcation may also be a source of undesired products, especially those whose appearance is unexpected. The viability of this scenario for intramolecular C-H insertion reactions affording $\beta$-lactones via Rh-carbenoid intermediates is assessed through quantum chemical calculations on potential energy surfaces and quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations. It appears that, in these cases, the rhodium catalyst is to blame for the accessibility of a second, unintended, pathway following the transition state structure for $\beta$-lactone formation that leads to fragmentation to a ketene and carbonyl compound. If an unexpected product is formed via a post-transition state bifurcation, conventional strategies for suppressing its formation are unlikely to succeed. Guidelines for recognizing the presence of a post-transition state bifurcation are described here, along with hints at means for controlling product distributions.},

Cophotolysis of noradamantyldiazirine with the phenanthride precursor of dichlorocarbene or phenylchlorodiazirine in pentane at room temperature produces noradamantylethylenes in 11{\%} yield with slight diastereoselectivity. Cophotolysis of adamantyldiazirine with phenylchlorodiazirine in pentane at room temperature generates adamantylethylenes in 6{\%} yield with no diastereoselectivity. 1H NMR showed the reaction of noradamantyldiazirine + phenylchlorodiazirine to be independent of solvent, and the rate of noradamantyldiazirine consumption correlated with the rate of ethylene formation. Laser flash photolysis showed that reaction of phenylchlorocarbene + adamantene was independent of adamantene concentration.

Calculations at the UB3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) and UM062X/6-31+G(d,p)//UB3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) levels show the formation of exocyclic ethylenes to proceed (a) on the singlet surface via stepwise addition of phenylchlorocarbene (PhCCl) to bridgehead alkenes adamantene and homoadamantene, respectively, producing an intermediate singlet diradical in each case, or (b) via addition of PhCCl to the diazo analogues of noradamantyl- and adamantyldiazirine. Preliminary direct dynamics calculations on adamantene + PhCCl show a high degree of recrossing (68{\%}), indicative of a flat transition state surface.
